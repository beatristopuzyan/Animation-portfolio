                <p><strong>Bringing Stories to Life, One Frame at a Time</strong></p>  
                <p>
                    Hi there! I’m Beatris Topuzyan, an animator and visual storyteller with a passion for transforming imagination into motion.
                    Animation, to me, is more than just a craft — it’s a language, a way to communicate emotions, ideas, and stories that words alone can’t always express.
                    From the first spark of inspiration to the final polished frame, I love every step of the creative process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work is rooted in a love for storytelling and character-driven narratives.
                    Whether it’s a hand-drawn character sketch that evolves into a fully animated scene or a simple concept that grows into an immersive world,
                    I’m drawn to projects that invite creativity, curiosity, and heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work primarily in Procreate or on a piece of paper, and I’m always experimenting with new techniques, from traditional frame-by-frame animation to digital.
                    The materials I use for traditional drawings include aquarels, acrylic markers, and alcoholic markers.
                    Each project, whether personal or collaborative, is a chance to learn something new and push my creative boundaries a little further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My inspiration comes from all around me — from the films and animated shorts I grew up watching, to the small everyday moments that spark an idea.
                    I’m especially drawn to stories with a sense of whimsy and wonder, ones that blend imagination with a touch of reality, and characters that feel alive in their own unique ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond animation, I love sketching ideas in my notebooks, building visual worlds through concept art, and diving into stories across different media — from comics and video games
                    to films, books, and even the occasional spontaneous doodle on a napkin.
                    Every piece of art, no matter how small, feeds into my creative process and helps me discover new ways to tell stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting my portfolio and taking the time to learn a bit about me and my work.
                    I hope my animations spark a sense of curiosity, joy, or wonder — and if you’re interested in collaborating, brainstorming ideas, or just geeking out about animation, I’d love to hear from you! ❤️
